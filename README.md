# MalWizNetX
MalWizNetX is an AI-powered malware detection system that uses graph theory, machine learning, and heuristics to detect suspicious patterns and connections in networks. It integrates OpenCV, Scikit-learn, and NetworkX to classify and classify malicious behavior, and utilizes mathematical modelling and anomaly detection to identify malicious activity. 

MalWizNetX is a prototype and is intended to be built upon to make it into what it was designed to become. It is a work in progress and as of now should be built off and extended to become more powerful. Any APIs used are closed source and a work in progress and likely will not be released to public due to licensing agreements, therefore someone should create an open source alternative to any closed-source APIs.
